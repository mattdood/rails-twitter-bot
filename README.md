# Rails Twitter Bot

## Purpose
This twitter bot is being used as an exploration of Rails as a Twitter back-end. Previously I created a simple Node.js app to serve as an introduction to interactions with Twitter. This app will serve as an intermediate level creation, with full uptime once it has been deployed in production.

## Models
- Users
- Bot
- Response
- Follower

## Roadmap
1. Tweet an automated, web-scraped tweet at a set interval.
2. Add relevant hashtags to each tweet.
3. Search for hashtags & respond to a predetermined number of tweets at a set interval.
4. Log every tweet in a database & keep record of new followers.
